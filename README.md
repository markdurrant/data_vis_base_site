# Title
## Sub-title 

## What is it 
This is just a blank template that you can put your hack day stuff into to make it just a little pretty. 

## Example
// show example

This is just a little [Rickshaw](http://code.shutterstock.com/rickshaw/) example. I chose Rickshaw because it's easy.

## How does it work
The project uses [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/) and [compass](http://compass-style.org/) for styling. 

I've also included [jQuery](http://jquery.com/) and [D3](http://d3js.org/) for you convenience.

And I'm using [showdown.js](https://github.com/coreyti/showdown) for markdown. Any `<div>` with a class of `markdown` will parse the markdown and spit out the appropriate html.

## Why
There's not going to be much time on the hack day so I've made a base to use as a starting point so people can get something pretty online quickly. 

## Who
I made this. My name is Mark. I have the Twitterz  [here](https://twitter.com/M6_D6).I work at [pebble{code}](http://pebblecode.com/). They are awesome.

## Licence 
This is released under the [IYETAUTIWCY licence]() (If You Even Think About Using This I Will Cut You Licence).
